Notice here Omega0 only includes the OmegaCDM and OmegaBaryon
And Omeganu for massive neutrinos only included in the background of evolution detailed in 'hubble_function'.

Added Parameters:

M_nu_all
Nur
CMBTemperature
DE_w0
DE_wa

Modified Files:
"hubble_function" in "src/time_integration/driftfac.h"
"omega_z" in "src/subfind/subfind_so.cc"
"F1_Omega" and "F2_Omega" in "src/gravity/second_order_ics.cc" (Notice this is only used when SECOND_ORDER_LPT_ICS is activated for the initial condition generate by Adrian Jenkin's IC code and not been tested yet. )

Now ngenic_f1_omega and ngenic_f2_omega has been rewritten for the Nu-w0waCDM universe.
And D1, D2, f1 f2 for the 2LPT are calculated by ODE and assume the initial condition starting from matter dominated universe (D1-->a, dD1/dlna --> a, D2 --> -3/7*a*a, dD2/dlna --> 2D2 aini=0.00625).
